Snake Pencil V1.2

Snake Pencil is an innovative drawing application that redefines the creative process by blending traditional manual input with advanced automated features. Built using the Kivy framework, Snake Pencil offers users a unique platform where they can control a "snake-like" cursor using keyboard inputs such as W, A, S, D for directional movements, and Q/E for diagonal motions. The inclusion of a fast mode, activated by holding the Shift key, allows for dynamic and swift drawing, catering to both precision and speed. This intuitive control scheme ensures that artists of all skill levels can effortlessly navigate the canvas, making the act of drawing both engaging and accessible.

One of the standout features of Snake Pencil is its ability to mirror user input with a contrasting color, adding a layer of symmetry and complexity to the artwork without additional effort from the user. As users draw, every stroke is automatically reflected across a vertical axis, creating visually striking patterns that enhance the aesthetic appeal of the creations. This mirroring capability is complemented by a palette of predefined templates, such as hearts, stars, and geometric shapes, which can be seamlessly integrated into the drawing through simple key presses (1-9). Additionally, the application supports automatic drawing modes like circles, figure eights, spirals, and random patterns, which can be toggled on or off via the user interface. These features not only expand the creative possibilities but also inspire users to experiment with intricate designs and symmetrical art effortlessly.

Enhancing the user experience further, Snake Pencil incorporates comprehensive UI elements that facilitate easy interaction and customization. Users can select their preferred drawing colors from a vibrant palette, ensuring that their artwork reflects their personal style. The application also includes functionality to save full-screen screenshots, capturing both the drawing and the surrounding UI components, making it simple to share creations with others. Whether engaged in manual drawing, utilizing automatic patterns, or integrating mirrored designs, Snake Pencil provides a harmonious blend of control and automation. This synergy between user input and automated assistance fosters a collaborative environment where creativity is amplified, making Snake Pencil a powerful tool for artists seeking both precision and artistic flair in their digital creations.
